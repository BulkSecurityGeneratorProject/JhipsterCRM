You should just expect this assigned to SC Assigner (Naisha) per usual unless you hear otherwise.

Sandra, it still may be 6 weeks before you receive this in HCSIS. Just making you aware. Thanks!

2018-09-05,"Good afternoon,

Questina Woods just called stating that she wants her services to begin and that it is urgent. She mentioned that she could be reached at 215-551-1816 or through her mother’s number 215-432-1774. I was not sure if you were still in charge of her case but I saw that you were the last person to try and get in contact with her in the CRM.

Kind Regards

Dear Diane Smith,

Thank you so much for choosing Blessings4Ever Home Care Agency for your homecare needs.  I look forward to working with you.

My name is Daleneysia Arnold and I will be your Intake Coordinator.  You can reach me between 9am and 5pm Monday through Friday at (215) 425-3950, ext. 117.

To get your services started, you first need to complete the application for Medicaid Medical Assistance.  I have included the paperwork.  If you need help completing it, please call me. I’m happy to assist.

The state requires a Physician Certification Form be completed by your doctor that determines your need for home services. I have included this form, but the state also sends this form directly to your physician. Please make sure this is completed and returned to either the state or my office.

I have included an Authorized Representative Form(s).  Please sign and return this form where indicated so that I may contact state agencies on your behalf for status updates. I have enclosed a self-addressed envelope.

Hello Jessica,
As per our conversation last week, I am in the process of gathering the paperwork for you to process her as a new client.  She misplaced her Medicare card, and the new one hasn't arrived.  She is going to call Medicare tomorrow for the needed information.
As for the bank account information, she has her own account, and she is also listed on her daughters account, since she is her daughters payee.  should that account info be included as well?
I have started my test packets and as soon as complete will bring them to you.  I am aiming for next Monday.
Thank you again for all your help.

Sincerely

Good afternoon,

Ricky Demetro called. He stated that he spoke to someone but does not remember who it was. Now he’s confused because he thinks another agency made an appointment to come see him but, he wants to have services with only Blessings.  Can someone please help? Call back number is #215-303-3115.

Dear Christopher And Patrick Cosby


Thank you so much for choosing Blessings4Ever Home Care Agency for your homecare needs.  I look forward to working with you.

My name is DALENEYSIA ARNOLD and I will be your Intake Coordinator.  You can reach me between 9am and 5pm Monday through Friday at (215) 425-3950, ext. 117.

To get your services started, you first need to complete the application for Medicaid Medical Assistance.  I have included the paperwork.  If you need help completing it, please call me. I’m happy to assist.

Good morning Diane, just wanted to touch base with you and inform you that I submitted the MA application and the other documents, I didn’t want to continue holding on to the application because it will delay the process. You can submit the rest of the documents as soon as possible, or when the county request them. If you have any questions please give me a call.

Enjoy the rest of your week, I will touch base with you next week, You should be receiving a call from PCA to schedule the level of care assessment.

Good Morning ,
                   I received a call from a PDA participant who will like to change SC companies to Cedar Woods . The participant will like to change due to the frustration of language barriers with the current SC company . I did inform the participant that in order to complete the change he will have to contact his SC company to complete the SC transfer  . Is there a way that we can make sure the participant gets setup with a Spanish SC if he completes the transfer  . The participant’s name is German Diaz he is over 76 (PDA)  4035 Maywood st Philadelphia PA 19120 and the phone number is 267-275-2399.

Good morning Diane, I received the documents and submitted them to the PAIEB, please let me know when you are coming in, so that I can give those documents back to you. I scanned them and emailed them so I don’t need to hang on to the originals.

Have you received a call from the Area Agency on Aging yet? They should have contacted you to schedule the first home visit. If not please give me a call so we can conference call the PAIEB (enrollment broker) so that we can make sure the have requested the Level of care assessment.

Dear MS. TINDLE


Thank you so much for choosing Blessings4Ever Home Care Agency for your homecare needs.  I look forward to working with you.

My name is DALENEYSIA ARNOLD and I will be your Intake Coordinator.  You can reach me between 9am and 5pm Monday through Friday at (215) 425-3950, ext. 117.

To get your services started, you first need to complete the application for Medicaid Medical Assistance.  I have included the paperwork.  If you need help completing it, please call me. I’m happy to assist.

The state requires a Physician Certification Form be completed by your doctor that determines your need for home services. I have included this form, but the state also sends this form directly to your physician. Please make sure this is completed and returned to either the state or my office.

I have included an Authorized Representative Form(s).  Please sign and return this form where indicated so that I may contact state agencies on your behalf for status updates. I have enclosed a self-addressed envelope.



Sincerely,

DALENEYSIA ARNOLD

Good afternoon Diane, I’m not sure what happened. The call must have dropped. The enrollment broker stated you should be receiving a call from PCA (Philadelphia Corporation for Aging) within 7 days to schedule the level of care assessment. You can also try to contact them yourself to schedule the home visit, let them know that Marie applied for the waiver services and you would like to request a level of care assessment. The phone number is 215.763.9000. If you are able to schedule please keep me informed with the appointment date.

Any questions please don’t hesitate to contact me, have a blessed day.

Dear Mr. John Latham


Thank you so much for choosing Blessings4Ever Home Care Agency for your homecare needs.  I look forward to working with you.

My name is DALENEYSIA ARNOLD and I will be your Intake Coordinator.  You can reach me between 9am and 5pm Monday through Friday at (215) 425-3950, ext. 117.

To get your services started, you first need to complete the application for Medicaid Medical Assistance.  I have included the paperwork.  If you need help completing it, please call me. I’m happy to assist.

The state requires a Physician Certification Form be completed by your doctor that determines your need for home services. I have included this form, but the state also sends this form directly to your physician. Please make sure this is completed and returned to either the state or my office.

I have included an Authorized Representative Form(s).  Please sign and return this form where indicated so that I may contact state agencies on your behalf for status updates. I have enclosed a self-addressed envelope.



Sincerely,

DALENEYSIA ARNOLD

Good afternoon Diane, how was the home visit yesterday? If the home visit was completed yesterday, Marie should be receiving a call from the Enrollment Broker within the next week or so to schedule the 2nd home visit. Please keep me posted. During the 2nd home visit Marie will need to choose a Supports Coordination Agency, and we work closely with one called Cedar Woods. I did send out a brochure and if you like I can have Kelsey from Cedar Woods Intake department call you or Marie to talk about the services that they provide.

Rescheduled appt. for Mon Jan 13 at 1 pm
I hope I can keep it – having major surgery later part for December, and requires LOTS of rehab and follow up Dr visits

She also gave me news I feared- they need a  whole new compass app. b/c the time frame has expired
BEFORE I go ahead and do that, I need to know if the LTIS deadline of Dec 6 will end  - Leaves 2 Q’s
1.	Do we need a home new case # for PAIEB and

     I am glad you were able to reschedule assessment. I sure hope you will be able to keep apt. I am sorry you need to complete the Pa600/ compass app
     I prefer the packet so you will have a copy for your records. As for the deadline all docs were submitted so dead line was met.
     Now for your ? I am unsure what you are asking about case #S if you like if you have a few moments I can call you after lunch around 2:30 to 2:45 ?

Hi Mrs. Boyd,

I was hoping you might provide me with a status update for our client Baretta Hudleston, DOB 01/18/1965. We received a blanket acceptance email on 08/13/2018 stating that financial determination would be made in 6 weeks. We have contacted the caseworker and the caseworker’s supervisor multiple times in regards to outstanding information they have requested. Our client has not received any requests and we are unable to confirm with your office what is needed to move the case along.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you,

Good morning Diane, hope all is well. Just wanted to check in with you and remind you of today’s home visit with the enrollment broker. Do you have any questions for me regarding what SC Agency to choose? If you are interested in choosing Cedar Woods our preferred provider please let them know they are the number 1 choice, they will ask you to choose 3 agencies but will send the case over to the 1st agency you choose. I will be in the office until 12pm today and will be back in tomorrow at 10:30am.

Hi Sylvia hope things are continuing to get better, I just wanted to follow up with you and check the status on the home visit, how did it go? Were you able to contact the doctor and get the PCF filled out? Please keep me posted! Our office will be closed on Monday and Tuesday so if I don’t hear back from you by today please try to have a Merry Christmas! Prayers are being sent.

Hey Jess,

I just received a voicemail from Linda and she called my CW # for some reason.

Can you call her back and call her friend Denise back? She found the letters that were sent to her that she thought you mailed. confirmed that she had 2 missed visits from PAIEB. You’ll need to contact Maximus via 3way phone call with her to ask why no one showed twice and to reschedule the appointment. Please make sure you give her your phone number and your extension so she calls you back via B4E #. Thanks!

Hi Silvia just wanted to check in, I hope you had a Merry Christmas. I wanted to follow up and check if PCA came out and conducted the home visit. I know you have somethings going on so I didn’t want to call, I rather sent an email and wait for a response. Please keep me posted. Have a blessed New Year!

Good afternoon, my name is Lauren Jennings and I oversee the LTSR’s in Philadelphia.  I received a call from Halia Home Community Services and they have an opening for a male individual.  I know you are Keith SC and I wanted to know if you can send a referral for Keith for this placement?  If you have any questions can you contact me as well.  Thank you

Sandra, please add this communication to the CRM.

Was this ever addressed? I see Sandra received final mailings in June and set up an LPN Hours Assessment.  Rachel spoke in July because the Assessor was refused permission to complete the Hours Assessment. Then Rachel then flipped the case from 8-pending initial assessment to closed/ineligible.

I see additional communication in October that the waiver remained active and no follow up.  I just checked enrollCHC and the consumer is with Keystone.

Can someone check to see if this is ours in Keystone’s system and if not, direct this question to Keystone?

Good afternoon,

I wanted to follow up in regards to Mr. Heard. We haven’t been contacted by the supervisor nor the Supports Coordinator Lead regarding Mr. Heard’s case. We are in the process of trying to find housing for Mr. Heard and confirmation of the status of his Aging Waiver is essential. Can you provide me with the direct email address/phone number for the supervisor and the Supports Coordinator Lead.

Thank you

Naisha,
Can you look this case up in Keystone? Have we received it?

Sandra,
Did you get a response from Kerri? I do not see it in CRM.
If this is not assigned to us, please respond to this woman and let her know we do not have this case as of xx/xx/xx date that Kerri informed you and that she needs to address her question to Keystone First.

Sandra, please add this communication to the CRM.

Was this ever addressed? I see Sandra received final mailings in June and set up an LPN Hours Assessment.  Rachel spoke in July because the Assessor was refused permission to complete the Hours Assessment. Then Rachel then flipped the case from 8-pending initial assessment to closed/ineligible.

I see additional communication in October that the waiver remained active and no follow up.  I just checked enrollCHC and the consumer is with Keystone.

Can someone check to see if this is ours in Keystone’s system and if not, direct this question to Keystone?

Marta has voicemails from the following consumers wanting updates from their SC.  A few questions for you:

1) Marta Garcia – This one we spoke about in the past. We are not sure when this consumer was approved but likely after 01/01/2019. She has had major health concerns take place recently and desperately needs her care plan to start. If she is with Keystone and not CW, can you bring this to their attention? She had selected CW during her application process and continues to call Marta to update her on her ailments.

2) James Braziel has left voicemails for Marta. Has he been received in ELTSS/HHA? Can he be temporarily assigned to an SC until the case has been received?

3) Terrance Bridget has left voicemails for Marta. Has he been received in ELTSS/HHA? Can he be temporarily assigned to an SC until the case has been received?

4) Robin Audain was out of state for a while and has since returned, reapplied, and been reapproved. Keystone is telling her she is assigned to us in HHA/ELTSS still and she would like to resume with us. Has she been received?

Thank you!

2019-01-18,"Hey Naisha,

Marta has voicemails from the following consumers wanting updates from their SC.  A few questions for you:

1) Marta Garcia – This one we spoke about in the past. We are not sure when this consumer was approved but likely after 01/01/2019. She has had major health concerns take place recently and desperately needs her care plan to start. If she is with Keystone and not CW, can you bring this to their attention? She had selected CW during her application process and continues to call Marta to update her on her ailments.

2) James Braziel has left voicemails for Marta. Has he been received in ELTSS/HHA? Can he be temporarily assigned to an SC until the case has been received?

3) Terrance Bridget has left voicemails for Marta. Has he been received in ELTSS/HHA? Can he be temporarily assigned to an SC until the case has been received?

4) Robin Audain was out of state for a while and has since returned, reapplied, and been reapproved. Keystone is telling her she is assigned to us in HHA/ELTSS still and she would like to resume with us. Has she been received?

Thank you!

Hey Naisha,

Has this person been assigned to us in ELTSS yet? We received final mailings/accepted this case on 12/20/2018 and the consumer would now like to transfer out of CW. Can someone be temporarily assigned and reach out to try to save this case?

FYI, I have attached the most recent unassigned case list. If there are any updates, please let me know ASAP. Thank you,

Breanne, we do not have this participant active on our caseload in HHA, so that is likely why the InterRAI has not been completed.

Do we still need to call Nicole? Did Rhonda follow up on this?

I am uncertain if you were going to use blessings 4ever for the Home care agency.

Good Morning,

I just got off the phone with the above participant,  I called to introduce myself also to make her aware that I will be continuing the process of helping her get approved for services.  She stated that she has gone with Patriot.  She states her coordinator advised her daughter to go with Patriot.  Her MCO is UPMC.  Please advise.

Hi Breanne,

I’m going to assign this to my new SC Maisha Culberth under PA Health & Wellness. She will be able to start doing assessment next week. I won’t be able to physically assign her this in Envolve because of the error they’re having but it will be apart of her caseload. Is there a contact number for this person?

Thanks.

Hey Naisha,

When I check PROMISe I see that this consumer was approved for ACW back on 11/09/2018. We never received the case. Currently PROMISe is showing Keystone for MCO and per Marta, Keystone is informing consumer to contact CW. Can you please have your rep look into this? Is Ekow assigned to CW?

Blessings needs the SAF from CW if so. If this is not assigned to CW, is your rep able to inform you who this case is with is Keystone would then be informing the consumer wrong information and she has been without services since 11/2018. Thank you,

I tried to schedule a date to come out but he said he didn’t know me and he didn’t understand why I wanted to come to his house.

Good morning,

The visit did not happen, I made a mistake and scheduled two people for the same day and time. I left a message on Stephanie’s phone but she hasn’t gotten back to me yet.

Good Afternoon Ms. Concepcion,

I understand that you will now be the coordinator for my father (Claud Johnson). Congratulations. I sent an email awhile back before you were assigned to him and I also called about having him placed back on the twice a month delivery of 14 meals per delivery for mom's meals. As it originally was set up before it was reduced. Please inform Mom's meals that he will be going back to his original delivery status so that I can put his order in.

Thank you so much for your time.

Respectfully,

Ms. K. Johnson

Subject: Pay Rate

Good Afternoon,

I have a participant by the name of Edward Campbell, I have brought him through the process of getting services.  He is a waiting for UPMC to call him with a time and date for his Interai.  His aide Gilbert Campbell came in and filled out the paperwork to be his aide with Blessings and was offered $10/hr for the services.  I received a call from Mr. Campbell stating that unfortunately because of the pay rate offered he may have to go with a different agency that pays more.  He asked if his pay could be raised to at least $12/hr being that Mr. Edward Campbell needs extensive care for a wound and medication he is on.  The participant has not yet received his hours from UPMC but he would like to discuss this because he was pleased with my customer service and would like to stay if this could be arranged.
